///What is System in the program. What is Console? What are Write, WriteLine
  
In C#, to print the data on the console output screen the following method are used â€“ Console.Write() and Console.WriteLine() method. Console is a predefined class of System namespace.
 
While Write() and WriteLine() both are the Console Class methods.

The only difference between the Write() and WriteLine() is that Console.Write is used to print data without printing the new line, while Console.WriteLine  is used to print data along with printing the new line.
